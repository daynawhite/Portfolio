            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As a former middle-school math teacher, I relish the idea of a new challenge.  With my goal-oriented personality and an adventurous spirit, I constantly seek to learn new things and accomplish new goals.</p>
            <p>The hats I have worn also include educational technologist, landscape designer, salesperson, remote learning specialist, stay-at-home mom, and coach. </p>
            <p>My love of nature comes from growing up in Colorado; but I nurture my love of live music in the Austin, Texas area, which has been my home since college.  I have raised three amazing children, all of whom also appreciate live music and proudly call themselves math nerds!</p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy all things outdoors.  Some of my favorite activities include running, rock-climbing, camping, hiking, snowboarding, martial arts, gardening, and landscape design.</p>
            <p>As often as possible, my dogs accompany me on my adventures in the outdoors, but my chickens prefer to stay at home!</p>
            <p>During my less active moments, I enjoy reading, learning to play a musical instrument or speak a new language, experimenting in the kitchen, or crafting something from recycled materials.</p>
